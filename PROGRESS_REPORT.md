# Hyperliquid Arbitrage Bot - CTO Progress Report
**Date:** 2025-01-10  
**Overall Completion:** 68%

## Executive Summary
The Hyperliquid arbitrage bot infrastructure has achieved production-grade evaluation modeling with sophisticated execution risk analysis. Core TypeScript evaluation service is operational with UniV3 math, observability, and testing infrastructure in place. Critical gaps remain in live execution, Hyperliquid-specific integration, and operational tooling.

## Technical Debt & Optimizations

### Medium Priority
- **Token Metadata Service** (stub exists, needs implementation)
- **Price Feed Aggregation** (design complete, not implemented)
- **Path Finding Algorithm** (skeleton ready, needs multi-hop)
- **MEV Protection** (basic design, needs private mempool integration)

### Low Priority  
- **UI Dashboard** (basic HTML exists, needs React upgrade)
- **Rust Engine** (directory exists, not implemented)
- **Historical Backtesting** (framework needed)

## Recommended Sprint Plan (Next 2 Weeks)

### **Week 1: Core Execution**
1. **Days 1-3:** Hyperliquid WebSocket + REST integration
2. **Days 4-5:** Signal generation and opportunity detection
3. **Weekend:** Contract compilation, testing, deployment

### **Week 2: Production Readiness**
1. **Days 1-2:** Transaction manager and live execution
2. **Days 3-4:** Risk management and safety systems
3. **Day 5:** Monitoring dashboards and alerts
4. **Weekend:** End-to-end testing and soft launch

---

## Resource Requirements

### Immediate Needs
- **RPC Endpoints:** Production Ethereum/L2 nodes
- **Hyperliquid API Keys:** Trading credentials
- **Infrastructure:** 
  - Application server (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM)
  - PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB instance
  - Redis cache
  - Monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana)

### Team Recommendations
- **1 Backend Engineer:** Focus on Hyperliquid integration
- **1 Smart Contract Engineer:** Deploy and audit contracts
- **1 DevOps/SRE:** Production infrastructure and monitoring

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **No Hyperliquid integration** - Complete blocker for production
2. **Untested contracts** - Could lose funds if bugs exist
3. **No circuit breakers** - Runaway losses possible

### Mitigation Strategy
1. Start with small position sizes
2. Implement hard stop-loss limits
3. Run paper trading for 1 week minimum
4. Get smart contract audit before mainnet

---

## Conclusion

The project has excellent foundational infrastructure with sophisticated risk modeling and evaluation capabilities. However, critical integration work remains for Hyperliquid connectivity and live execution. With focused effort on the critical path items, the bot could be production-ready in 2-3 weeks.

**Recommended Action:** Prioritize Hyperliquid integration immediately while parallel-tracking smart contract deployment.
